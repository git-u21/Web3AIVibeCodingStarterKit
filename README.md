## Steps for Developing Web3 Apps with AI VibeCoding

1.  **Decide what you want to build.**
    *   For this workshop, let's build an AMM DEX!

2.  **Create a requirements definition and design document for what you want to build.** (Using Kiro or GitHub Spec-kit is recommended).
    *   It's also a good idea to have a separate AI coding tool review the generated documents.

3.  **Create a task list based on the requirements definition.** (Using Kiro or GitHub Spec-kit is recommended).
    *   It's also a good idea to have a separate AI coding tool review the generated list.

4.  **Start implementation.**
    It's better to proceed in stages rather than developing the contract and front-end all at once.
    *   Overall project setup
    *   Smart contract implementation (including tests and task file implementation)
    *   Smart contract functional verification
    *   Front-end implementation
    *   Refine the design
    *   E2E testing
    *   Completion

## Tips for Successful AI VibeCoding

1.  **Use multiple models for different tasks:**
    *   **For requirements definition, task list creation, and review:**
        *   Gemini
    *   **For coding:**
        *   Claude

2.  **Enhance AI capabilities using MCP:**
    *   **For understanding the entire project:**
        *   Serena MCP
    *   **For referencing the latest code and documents:**
        *   context7
    *   **To break down complex problems into small steps and explicitly track the progress of the entire thought process:**
        *   sequential-thinking

3.  **Proceed in stages:**
    *   Create requirements definition
    *   Create task list
    *   Overall project setup
    *   Smart contract implementation
    *   Front-end implementation

4.  **Set up custom instruction files:**
    *   This is very important!
    *   Be aware that settings differ slightly for each coding agent!

5.  **Specification-Driven Development is crucial!**
    *   Once you've decided what to build, solidify the specifications instead of jumping straight into implementation.
    *   Utilize Kiro and GitHub Spec-kit.

6.  **Context Engineering is also important!**
    *   To get higher quality output with complex configurations, context engineering is just as important as prompt engineering!
    *   Let's solidify the specifications using Kiro or GitHub Spec-kit to provide high-quality context to the coding agent!
